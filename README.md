# Practical-Machine-Learning
This repo has been created for the Practical Machine Learning Coursera Project.
The peer assesment goal is to analyse a sample of Human Activity Recognition data and build a classifier based on machine learning algorithms.

The repo contains:

1. pml_projectassesment.Rmd (R Markdown file with the report of the analysis)

2. pml_projectassesment.html (compiled version of the report)

3. ResultsSubmission.R (R script to submit the classifier output to the 20 test cases available in the test data)

and two directories with the data sample and the classifier results.
